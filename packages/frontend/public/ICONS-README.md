# PWA Icons

You need to add the following icons to this directory for the PWA to work properly:

## Required Icons:

1. **icon-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels
   - Used for Android home screen
   - Should be a square icon with your tea cup or app logo

2. **icon-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels
   - Used for Android splash screens
   - Should be a square icon with your tea cup or app logo

## Quick Icon Generation:

You can generate these icons using:
- **Online tools**: realfavicongenerator.net, favicon.io
- **Design tools**: Figma, Canva, Adobe Express
- **AI tools**: DALL-E, Midjourney with prompt "tea cup app icon, minimalist, green theme"

## Tips:

- Use a green theme color (#10b981) to match the app
- Make sure icons work on both light and dark backgrounds
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Include some tea-related imagery (tea cup, tea leaf, steam)

## Temporary Solution:

For now, you can use a simple green square with a tea cup emoji or text as a placeholder.

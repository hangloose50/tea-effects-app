# Green Tea: Complete Catechin Guide & Therapeutic Applications

_(Approx. 2,050 words)_

## 1. Executive Summary
Green tea (*Camellia sinensis*) represents the most extensively researched therapeutic beverage globally, with over 2,000 published studies documenting its health benefits. Unlike black or oolong teas, green tea's minimal oxidation processing preserves 85-95% of original catechins, particularly **epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)**, which comprises 50-80% of total catechin content. This preservation occurs through rapid heat treatment (steaming in Japan, pan-firing in China) within 4-12 hours of harvest, inactivating polyphenol oxidase enzymes that would otherwise convert catechins to theaflavins.

Green tea's therapeutic window spans 300-800mg catechins daily (3-6 cups of quality tea), providing benefits across metabolic, cardiovascular, neurological, and oncological domains. Japanese varieties (Sencha, Gyokuro, Matcha) excel in L-theanine content (20-50mg/g) creating synergistic cognitive effects, while Chinese varieties (Longjing, Bi Luo Chun) develop unique flavor compounds through Maillard reactions during pan-firing. Understanding processing methods, variety characteristics, and preparation optimization enables precision therapeutic application.

## 2. Processing & Catechin Chemistry

### 2.1 Enzymatic Inactivation Methods
**Japanese Steaming (Mushisei)**: Exposes fresh leaves to 95-100°C steam for 30-90 seconds (light steaming/asamushi) or 120-180 seconds (deep steaming/fukamushi). This method preserves maximum chlorophyll and amino acids while preventing catechin oxidation. Steam temperature and duration critically influence final product: light steaming maintains leaf integrity and delicate flavor, while deep steaming breaks cell walls for enhanced extraction.

**Chinese Pan-Firing (Chaoqing)**: Direct contact with 260-320°C heated woks for 2-4 minutes creates distinctive roasted notes through controlled Maillard reactions. Temperature gradients across the wok surface allow skilled producers to modulate oxidation levels, creating complexity while preserving 75-85% of catechins.

### 2.2 Catechin Molecular Profiles
- **EGCG (Epigallocatechin-3-gallate)**: 50-80% of total catechins, molecular weight 458.4 g/mol, features trihydroxylated B-ring conferring superior antioxidant capacity (TEAC: 4.2, ORAC: 4,500 μmol TE/g)
- **EGC (Epigallocatechin)**: 10-20% of catechins, enhanced water solubility but reduced membrane permeability
- **ECG (Epicatechin-3-gallate)**: 10-15% of catechins, moderate antioxidant activity with enhanced protein binding
- **EC (Epicatechin)**: 5-10% of catechins, most bioavailable form with peak plasma concentration in 60-90 minutes

### 2.3 Bioavailability Optimization
Catechin absorption remains limited (0.1-5% for EGCG) due to poor membrane permeability, first-pass metabolism, and gut microbiome degradation. Enhancement strategies include:
- **Vitamin C co-administration**: 6-fold absorption increase through pH stabilization and reduction of oxidized forms
- **Lipid emulsification**: 20-30% improved absorption with 5-10g healthy fats
- **Quercetin synergy**: 3-4 fold increase in unconjugated plasma EGCG through glucuronidation inhibition
